# P1-project
Her er vores P1 projekt - A program, that solves an issue!

## Objective
That the student acquires skills in problem-oriented project work in a group as well as knowledge of connections between problem definition, the role of model formations in understanding and constructing programs, and programs as a solution to a problem in a problem context. Furthermore, to gain knowledge about the subject's content and the subject's further potentials.

# Learning objectives

## Knowledge

  - Theories and methods for analyzing the chosen problem.
  - Concepts in programming used in connection with the project.
  - The contextual context of the project.
  - Project management

## Skills

  - Delemit a problem towards a problem statement.
  - Apply concepts and tools for problem-based project work.
  - Choose, describe and apply a method for organizing group cooperation and for resolving any group conflicts.

  - Use collaboration tools to be able to design and organize the group's documents and programs.
  - Reflect on the problem-based learning in the project context.
  - Communicate the project's work results and work processes in a structered and comprehensible way, both in writing and orally.

## More skills

  - Analyze a problem in software.
  - Formulate a problem where programming can be included as part of the solution.
  - Include relevant concepts and methods for assesing the project's solutions in relation to the context of the problem.
  - Participate in the development of a small, high-quality program.
  - Describe and discuss the essential characteristics of the program that contribute to the quality of the program.

# Teaching method

Project work is supported by the courses during the semester and by digital learning resources in group and writing tools. In the middle of the project period, a status seminar is held, where the project group presents problem formulation, work results and experience with the work process. After submitting the project report, a collection of experiences is held, where a number of project groups present their experiences with the project's work process. The collection of experience forms the basis for the individual group's process analysis.
